Customer Churn Predictor

This is Customer Churn Predictor, a project I built to help businesses see if a customer is likely to leave or stay based on a few simple details.

dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullah0a/telecom-customer-churn-insights-for-analysis

What it does:

You can enter details like age, tenure, monthly charges, and gender, and it instantly tells you if that customer is likely to churn.

Itâ€™s a Streamlit web app, so itâ€™s super easy to use and gives real-time predictions.

Under the hood:

Uses a trained machine learning model (model.pkl) and a scaler (scaler.pkl) to analyze your input.

Looks at customer demographics and account details to make its prediction:

ðŸš© Likely to Churn

âœ… Likely to Stay

This tool is perfect for quickly identifying at-risk customers so businesses can act early.
